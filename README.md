# CodeAlpha_task4-Sentiment-Analysis-on-web-Scraping-
This project combines Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis to extract textual data from the web (e.g., product reviews, news articles, tweets) and analyze the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). The aim is to transform raw, unstructured web data into meaningful insights that can help in decision-making, business intelligence, and trend analysis.

⚙️ Key Steps

Web Scraping

Extracting text data (reviews, comments, articles) from websites.

Handling dynamic content using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or Scrapy.

Storing data in CSV/Excel for analysis.

Data Preprocessing

Cleaning text (removing stopwords, special characters, HTML tags).

Tokenization and lemmatization using NLTK / spaCy.

Converting text to numerical representation (TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words).

Sentiment Analysis

Applying VADER, TextBlob, or Machine Learning models to classify sentiment.

Labeling data as positive, negative, or neutral.

Data Visualization

Visualizing sentiment distribution using bar charts and pie charts.

Word clouds for most frequent positive and negative words.

Time-series sentiment trends (if data is time-based, e.g., news or tweets).

Insights Generation

Identifying customer satisfaction trends.

Spotting negative feedback clusters.

Understanding public opinion on products, services, or events.
